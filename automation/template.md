This list updates once a day[^autoupdate], feel free to [add any missing playlists](#add-a-playlist) or [read the announcement post](https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/osrs-ironmen-list-of-youtube-series/).

## Add a playlist

To add a playlist, raise a PR editing [`playlists.txt`](https://github.com/JakeSteam/osrs-ironmen/blob/main/automation/playlists.txt) to include the playlist ID and name:
* Playlist ID can be retrieved from the playlist's URL (everything after `?list=`).
* Playlist name is used for the first column, shorter is better.

Alternatively, drop an email to [osrs@jakelee.co.uk](mailto:osrs@jakelee.co.uk) and I'll add it manually.

### Notes

[^autoupdate]: Uses a modified version of [my YouTube channel script](https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/fetching-youtube-metadata-in-github-actions-and-persisting/).
[^max-videos]: Note that only 50 playlist videos can be fetched at once via YouTube's API, and pagination is not currently implemented.
